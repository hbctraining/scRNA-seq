* Perform clustering of cells based on significant PCs

# Single-cell RNA-seq clustering analysis

Now that we have our high quality cells integrated, we want to know the different cell types present within our population of cells.

_**Goals:**_ 
 
 - _To **generate cell type-specific clusters** and use known cell type marker genes to determine the identities of the clusters._
 - _To **determine whether clusters represent true cell types or cluster due to biological or technical variation**, such as clusters of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, clusters of specific batches, or cells with high mitochondrial content._

_**Challenges:**_
 
 - _**Identifying poor quality clusters** that may be due to uninteresting biological or technical variation_
 - _**Identifying the cell types** of each cluster_
 - _Maintaining patience as this can be a highly iterative process between clustering and marker identification (sometimes even going back to the QC filtering)_

_**Recommendations:**_
 
 - _Have a good idea of your expectations for the **cell types to be present** prior to performing the clustering. Know whether you expect cell types of low complexity or higher mitochondrial content AND whether the cells are differentiating_
 - _If you have **more than one condition**, it's often helpful to perform integration to align the cells_
 - _**Regress out** number of UMIs (by default with sctransform), mitochondrial content, and cell cycle, if needed and appropriate for experiment, so not to drive clustering_
 - _Identify any junk clusters for removal or re-visit QC filtering. Possible junk clusters could include those with high **mitochondrial content** and low UMIs/genes. If comprised of a lot of cells, then may be helpful to go back to QC to filter out, then re-integrate/cluster._
 - _If **not detecting all cell types as separate clusters**, try changing the resolution or the number of PCs used for clustering_

## Clustering cells based on top PCs (metagenes)

### Identify significant PCs

To overcome the extensive technical noise in the expression of any single gene for scRNA-seq data, **Seurat assigns cells to clusters based on their PCA scores derived from the expression of the integrated most variable genes**, with each PC essentially representing a "metagene" that combines information across a correlated gene set. **Determining how many PCs to include in the clustering step is therefore important to ensure that we are capturing the majority of the variation**, or cell types, present in our dataset. 

It is useful to explore the PCs prior to deciding which PCs to include for the downstream clustering analysis.

(a) One way of exploring the PCs is using a heatmap to visualize the most variant genes for select PCs with the **genes and cells ordered by PCA scores**. The idea here is to look at the PCs and determine whether the genes driving them make sense for differentiating the different cell types. 

The `cells` argument specifies the number of cells with the most negative or postive PCA scores to use for the plotting. The idea is that we are looking for a PC where the heatmap starts to look more "fuzzy", i.e. where the distinctions between the groups of genes is not so distinct.

```r
# Explore heatmap of PCs
DimHeatmap(seurat_integrated, 
           dims = 1:9, 
           cells = 500, 
           balanced = TRUE)
```

</p>

This method can be slow and hard to visualize individual genes if we would like to explore a large number of PCs. In the same vein and to explore a large number of PCs, we could print out the top 10 (or more) positive and negative genes by PCA scores driving the PCs.

```r
# Printing out the most variable genes driving PCs
print(x = seurat_integrated[["pca"]], 
      dims = 1:10, 
      nfeatures = 5)
```

</p>

(b) The **elbow plot** is another helpful way to determine how many PCs to use for clustering so that we are capturing majority of the variation in the data. The elbow plot visualizes the standard deviation of each PC, and we are looking for where the standard deviations begins to plateau. Essentially, **where the elbow appears is usually the threshold for identifying the majority of the variation**. However, this method can be quite subjective. 

Let's draw an elbow plot using the top 40 PCs:

```r
# Plot the elbow plot
ElbowPlot(object = seurat_integrated, 
          ndims = 40)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/SC_elbowplot.png" width="500">
</p>

Based on this plot, we could roughly determine the majority of the variation by where the elbow occurs around PC8 - PC10, or one could argue that it should be when the data points start to get close to the X-axis, PC30 or so. This gives us a very rough idea of the number of PCs needed to be included, we can extract the information visualized here in a [**more quantitative manner**](elbow_plot_metric.md), which may be a bit more reliable.  

While the above 2 methods were used a lot more with older methods from Seurat for normalization and identification of variable genes, they are no longer as important as they used to be. This is because the **SCTransform method is more accurate than older methods**.

**Why is selection of PCs more important for older methods?**

The older methods incorporated some technical sources of variation into some of the higher PCs, so selection of PCs was more important. SCTransform estimates the variance better and does not frequently include these sources of technical variation in the higher PCs. 

In theory, with SCTransform, the more PCs we choose the more variation is accounted for when performing the clustering, but it take a lot longer to perform the clustering. Therefore for this analysis, we will use the **first 40 PCs** to generate the clusters. 

### Cluster the cells

Seurat uses a graph-based clustering approach, which embeds cells in a graph structure, using a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph (by default), with edges drawn between cells with similar gene expression patterns. Then, it attempts to partition this graph into highly interconnected ‘quasi-cliques’ or ‘communities’ [[Seurat - Guided Clustering Tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.1/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)].

We will use the `FindClusters()` function to perform the graph-based clustering. The `resolution` is an important argument that sets the "granularity" of the downstream clustering and will need to be optimized for every individual experiment.  For datasets of 3,000 - 5,000 cells, the `resolution` set between `0.4`-`1.4` generally yields good clustering. Increased resolution values lead to a greater number of clusters, which is often required for larger datasets. 

The `FindClusters()` function allows us to enter a series of resolutions and will calculate the "granularity" of the clustering. This is very helpful for testing which resolution works for moving forward without having to run the function for each resolution.

```r
# Determine the K-nearest neighbor graph
seurat_integrated <- FindNeighbors(object = seurat_integrated, 
                                dims = 1:40)
                                
# Determine the clusters for various resolutions                                
seurat_integrated <- FindClusters(object = seurat_integrated,
                               resolution = c(0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.4))
```

If we look at the metadata of our Seurat object(`seurat_integrated@metadata`), there is a separate column for each of the different resolutions calculated.

```r
# Explore resolutions
seurat_integrated@meta.data %>% 
        View()
```

To choose a resolution to start with, we often pick something in the middle of the range like 0.6 or 0.8. We will start with a resolution of 0.8 by assigning the identity of the clusters using the `Idents()` function.

```r
# Assign identity of clusters
Idents(object = seurat_integrated) <- "integrated_snn_res.0.8"
```

To visualize the cell clusters, there are a few different dimensionality reduction techniques that can be helpful. The most popular methods include [t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/217265066-What-is-t-Distributed-Stochastic-Neighbor-Embedding-t-SNE-) and [Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) techniques. 

Both methods aim to place cells with similar local neighborhoods in high-dimensional space together in low-dimensional space. These methods will require you to input number of PCA dimentions to use for the visualization, we suggest using the same number of PCs as input to the clustering analysis. Here, we will proceed with the [UMAP method](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html) for visualizing the clusters.

```r
# Calculation of UMAP
seurat_integrated <- RunUMAP(seurat_integrated, 
                  reduction = "pca", 
                  dims = 1:40)

# Plot the UMAP
DimPlot(seurat_integrated,
        reduction = "umap",
        label = TRUE,
        label.size = 6)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/SC_umap.png" width="800">
</p>

It can be useful to **explore other resolutions as well**. It will give you a quick idea about how the clusters would change based on the resolution parameter. For example, let's switch to a resolution of 0.4:

```r
# Assign identity of clusters
Idents(object = seurat_integrated) <- "integrated_snn_res.0.4"

# Plot the UMAP
DimPlot(seurat_integrated,
        reduction = "umap",
        label = TRUE,
        label.size = 6)
```

<p align="center">

</p>

**How does your UMAP plot compare to the one above?**

It is possible that there is some variability in the way your clusters look compared to the image in this lesson. In particular **you may see a difference in the labeling of clusters**. This is an unfortunate consequence of slight variations in the versions of packages (mostly Seurat dependencies).

**If your clusters look identical to what's in the lesson, please go ahead to the next section without any downloads.**

***

**If your clusters do look different from what we have in the lesson**, please right-click and download [this Rdata file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sz2xpg43xnbv7qx/seurat_integrated.RData.bz?dl=1) to the `data` folder. It contains the seurat_integrated object that we have created for the class. 

Once that large file has downloaded, you will need to:

1. Unzip the file by double-clicking
2. **Load in the object to your R session and overwrite the existing one**: 

```r
load("data/seurat_integrated.RData")
```

***

We will now continue with the 0.8 resolution to check the quality control metrics and known markers for the anticipated cell types. Plot the UMAP again to make sure your image now (or still) matches what you see in the lesson:

```r
# Assign identity of clusters
Idents(object = seurat_integrated) <- "integrated_snn_res.0.8"

# Plot the UMAP
DimPlot(seurat_integrated,
        reduction = "umap",
        label = TRUE,
        label.size = 6)
```
